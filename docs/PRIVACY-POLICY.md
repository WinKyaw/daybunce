# Privacy Policy for DayBunce

**Effective Date:** November 30, 2025  
**Last Modified:** November 30, 2025

DayBunce (“the App”) is provided by InventSight (Developer: Kyaw Win) (“we”, “us”, or “our”). This policy explains what data the App processes, how and why we process it, and your choices.

We designed DayBunce to work primarily offline. Your inventory and settings are stored on your device and are not sent to our servers.

---

## Summary

- We do not sell your data.
- We do not use third‑party advertising or cross‑app tracking.
- Inventory data and settings are stored locally on your device.
- DayBunce does not transmit images or other user content to our servers in the current version.

---

## Data We Process

### 1) On‑device data (stored locally)
- Inventory items (names, categories, unit types, prices, quantities)
- Predefined items you create or import (CSV/JSON you choose)
- App settings (language, currency, custom app title)
- UI preferences (filters, sort options, daily confirmation states)

This information is stored locally on your device (e.g., AsyncStorage). You can remove entries, reset predefined items, export your data, or uninstall the App to delete this data.

### 2) Diagnostics (platform‑provided)
- Basic crash or usage information that may be provided by the operating system or app store if you have enabled such sharing on your device. We do not embed third‑party analytics SDKs.

---

## How We Use Data

- Provide and improve core features (inventory tracking, daily summaries, import/export, PDF/print/share).
- Handle customer support if you contact us (we receive only the information you choose to provide).

We do not build advertising profiles, track you across apps, or combine your data with third‑party datasets.

---

## App Permissions and Purposes

- Camera (optional): Used for optional OCR scanning of receipts/items.
- Photo Library/Gallery & Document Picker (optional): Used for importing/choosing images and exporting CSV/JSON/PDF via system share.
- Printing/Sharing (optional): generate and share daily summaries (PDF or text) using the system share sheet.

DayBunce does not use the Microphone permission.

---

## Network Communications

- The App may communicate with Apple or Google services for store delivery and updates. We do not collect personal data via our own servers in the current version.

---

## Data Storage and Retention

- On‑device inventory/settings persist until you delete them. The app may periodically clean older daily entries (e.g., after ~30 days) as part of local housekeeping.
- Support communications you send us are retained as needed to address your request and comply with legal obligations.

---

## Sharing of Data

We do not sell personal data. We share data only:
- As required by law, to protect rights and safety, or to comply with legal process.

We do not enable third‑party advertising or tracking.

---

## International Transfers

The current version of DayBunce does not transmit your personal data to our servers. If we introduce cloud features in the future, we will update this section and apply appropriate safeguards.

---

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate to a local‑first app (e.g., least‑privilege access for code, modern platform security). However, no method of storage is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## Your Choices and Rights

- Delete local data: Remove items in‑app, clear predefined items, or uninstall the App.
- Exports: You may export your data (CSV/JSON or PDF) using system share features.
- Contact us: For privacy questions or requests related to support messages you’ve sent us, email windaybunce@gmail.com.

Depending on your location, you may have legal rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. Contact us to exercise these rights.

---

## Children’s Privacy

DayBunce is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your jurisdiction). Do not use the App if you are under the applicable age.

---

## App Store Privacy Disclosures (iOS)

We disclose the following in App Store Connect for the current version:
- Data collected: “Data Not Collected” by the developer. Inventory data is stored on‑device.
- No tracking: We do not track users across apps or websites.

If functionality changes (e.g., adding cloud sync), we will update these disclosures before release.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. The latest version will be available at https://winkyaw.github.io/daybunce/PRIVACY-POLICY.html. Material changes will be indicated by updating the “Last updated” date and, where appropriate, additional notice.
